# Spider Indetifier by Camera
[In progress]  Identify spider species using a camera.

## The Problem
Identify a spider using a cell phone camera, and find out if the spider is poisonous or not, its risks and symptoms of its poison. To help biologists and people to differentiate the types of spiders and risks can be brought.

## The Project Goals
- [ ] Read a spider image
- [ ] Treat the image
- [ ] Identify that it is not a spider
- [ ] Identify that it is a spider
- [ ] Collect and classify spider images and create a database
- [ ] Train the algorithm
- [ ] Compare the image with the image database
- [ ] Identify the species of the spider
- [ ] Integrate with cell phone camera
- [ ] Make tests
- [ ] Evaluate the efficiency of the Algorithm
- [ ] Make corrections if necessary

## Challenges
The quality of the image can and the quality of the cell phone's camera can influence the result, leading the algorithm to identify something different than a spider.
